# Clean DETR - Clean DETR implementation in modern PyTorch
Opinionated implementation of DETR in PyTorch. Following what I believe to be best practices for computer vision models in PyTorch.

* Modular design (clean as in clean code, not clean as in cleanRL one alorithm per file approach)
* based on PyTorch [`@tensorclass (TensorDict)`](https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict) library
